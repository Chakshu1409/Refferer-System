## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

### Profit Distribution Logic:

- **Level 1**: Parent user earns `5%` of their direct referral’s valid purchases.
- **Level 2**: Grandparent user earns `1%` from their direct referral's referral purchases.
- **Condition**: Only triggered if purchase amount > ₹1000.

### Data Flow:
1. User signs up → receives unique `UUID`.
2. Referrals use UUID to register → system checks parent’s referral cap.
3. Purchase triggers profit distribution:
   - Store purchase
   - Credit profit to parent & grandparent
   - Update in real-time using WebSocket
